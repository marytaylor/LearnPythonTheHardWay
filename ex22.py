Make a list of every word and symbol that you have used.  Write what it does.

#• python -> runs python scripts
#• quit() -> quits python terminal when it is running.
#• print -> prints any text within quotations.
#• "" -> used to keep words together
#• '' -> works the same as ""
#• # -> octothorpe, pound, hash - used to create comments within code.
#• + plus -> adds
#• - minus -> subtracts or makes a negative
#• / slash -> divides
#• * asterisk -> multiplies
#• % percent -> divides two values and outputs the remainder
#• < less than
#• > greater than
#• <= less than or equal too
#• <= greather than or equal too
#• , -> used to separate arguments, makes sure an extra line is not added in
#       some cases
#• variables -> use this to declare a value, functions, or others things to a
#       certain name
#• _ -> used to represent spaces when creating variables, functions or other
#       things
#• % -> used to help with filling formatted characters
#• %s -> this is the string formatted character
#• %r -> also a string formatted character but this is used when the value needs
#       to be 'read' also creates an object to help with debugging.
#• %d -> integer formatting
#• round() -> lets you round a floating point number
#• string -> usually a bit of text but can contain format characters
#• True -> a value or variable is True
#• False -> a value or variable is False
#• \n -> new line
#• """ or ''' -> Lets you write muliple lines of text within one print function
#• Escape Quotes: written as \' or \" within quotes to escape that specific quote
#• \t -> creates a Tab
#• \\ -> escapes \ so that \ will appear within text
#• \b -> backspaces
#• \r -> carriage return - like a new line
#• raw_input() -> gets input from a person but removes any formatting (i.e.
#       integers will be considered text.)
#• from -> used to retrieve a module
#• sys -> really useful module; it provides access to any command-line arguments
#• import -> pulls in a specific method from the module
#• argv -> argument vector
#• open() -> opens a file
#• read() -> reads a file
#• close() -> closes and saves a file [depending on the way read is used closed
#       is not necessary]
#• truncate() -> This empties the file
#• write() -> writes stuff inside of the file
#• readline() -> reads just one line of the file
#• os.path -> module; implements some useful funcitons on pathnames.
#• exists -> function; returns TRUE if the path exists
#• len() -> function that gives the length of a input
#• def -> starts to define a function
#• * -> tells python to take all the arguments and put them in args
#• function -> does something
#• variable -> gives a name to a value, function, or etc.
#• seek() -> this deals with bytes and moves the files to the declared value.
#• += -> increments a value
#• return -> value from a function
